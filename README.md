## Requirements
Monster Brewery is a Java program, so you will need a Java Runtime Environment installed on your computer. Everything else is contained in the .jar file.

## Donate
I hope to offer support for as long as Monster Brewery is useful to people, but it took time to make, and maintaining it will take additional time. Please consider donating to help keep this project alive.
